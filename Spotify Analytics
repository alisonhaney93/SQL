# For this project, I downloaded Spotify (2021) data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

# Creating the table for the BIT_DB database:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

Then, I inserted the Spotify Data .csv file into the table.

# Next, I explored the data using the following SQL queries by answering a variety of questions I developed about the data.

# How many different artists are in the top 50 most popular Spotify songs?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata;

# Which artist had the most hits in 2021? (included limit of 2 since artists were tied for most number of hits)

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(artist_name) as artist_hits
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY artist_hits DESC
LIMIT 2;

# What was the most common key in the top 50 most popular spotify songs?

SELECT key, COUNT(key) AS key_occurence
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY key
ORDER BY key_occurence DESC
LIMIT 1;

# What were the top 10 most popular songs and the names of the artists?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

# What were the top 10 most danceable songs and the names of the artists?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Are major or minor keys more common in 2021 Spotify hits? (see mode: major = 1 and minor = 0)

SELECT mode, COUNT(mode) as mode_frequency
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY mode
ORDER BY mode_frequency;

# What is the average, minimum, and maximum acousticness of the top 50 spotify songs?

SELECT AVG(acousticness), MIN(acousticness), MAX(acousticness)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata;

# What is the most common time signature of popular songs on Spotify?

SELECT time_signature, COUNT(time_signature) as ts_frequency
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY time_signature
ORDER BY ts_frequency DESC
LIMIT 1;

# What was the length of the average Spotify hit song in minutes?

SELECT AVG(duration_ms)/60000YU87 AS average_duration_minutes
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata;

# What is the average, minimum, and maximum loudness 

SELECT track_name, artist_name, energy
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata

# What is the average popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track?

SELECT artist_name,
track_name,
AVG(popularity),
AVG(danceability),
AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;
