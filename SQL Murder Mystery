# In this SQL, I solve the murder mystery problem from [this website](https://mystery.knightlab.com/)

## Here is the scenario from the SQL Murder Mystery: "A crime has taken place and the detevtive needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on Jan. 15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department's database."

# First, I ran a query to identify all of the crimes from the crime_scene_report table that met the criteria from the scenario description. 

SELECT * FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE type = 'murder'
AND city = 'SQL City'
AND date = '20180115';

# This query returned only one result and its description read: "Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on 'Northwestern Dr'. The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on 'Franklin Ave'."

# Next, I ran a query to get more identifying information about the witnesses from the name table.

SELECT * FROM person
WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
ORDER BY address_number DESC;

# This provided me with the following information about the first witness: id 14887, name Morty Schapiro, license_id 118009, address_number 4919, address_street_name Northwestern Dr, ssn 111564949

SELECT * FROM person
WHERE address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'
AND name = 'Annabel';

# This provided me with the following information about the second witness: id 16371, name Annabel Miller, license_id 490173, address_number 103, address_street_name Franklin Ave, ssn 318771143

# Then I used the witnesses person_ids from the previous queries to pull the transcripts of their statements from the interview table

SELECT * FROM interview
WHERE person_id = 14887
OR person_id = 16371;

# Morty's interview transcript revealed the following information: "I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a 'Get Fit Now Gym' bag. The membership number on the bad started with '48Z'. Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included 'H42W'."

# Annabel's interview transcript revealed the following information: "I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th."

# I used Morty's claim that the murderer's gym membership started with "48Z" and Annabel's claim that she saw the killer on January 9th to gather more information from the get_fit_now_check_in table

SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_check_in
WHERE membership_id LIKE '48Z%'
AND check_in_date = '20180109';

# This query resulted in two potential member_ids: 48Z7A and 48Z55

# I used the member_ids to pull more information about these members from the get_fit_now_member table

SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_member
WHERE id = '48Z7A'
OR id = '48Z55';

# This showed me the following information about member 48Z55/suspected killer 1: person_id 67318, name Jeremy Bowers, membership_start_date 20160101, membership_status gold
# And the following information about member 48Z7A/suspected killer 2: person_id 28819, name Joe Germuska, membership_start_date 20160305, membership_status gold

# Morty claimed in his interview that the killer must have been a gold member at Get Fit Now Gym because of his specialized member bag. But since both of the "48Z" members had gold status, I used the drivers_license table and additional information from Morty's interview to find more clues.

SELECT * FROM drivers_license
WHERE plate_number LIKE '%H42W%';

# This provided me with three potential suspected drivers operating the vehicle in which the killer escaped. Their information was as follows:

# Suspected driver 1: id 183779, age 21, height 65, eye_color blue, hair_color blonde, gender female, plate_number H42W0X, car_make Toyota, car_model Prius
# Suspected driver 2: id 423327, age 30, height 70, eye_color brown, hair_color brown, gender male, plate_number 0H42W2, car_make Chevrolet, car_model Spark LS
# Suspected driver 3: id 664760, age 21, height 71, eye_color black, hair_color black, gender male, plate_number 4H42WR, car_make Nissan, car_model Altima

# I wanted to determine if any of these suspects had made their own statements about the murder, so I ran the following query to pull their transcrips from the interview table

SELECT * FROM interview
WHERE person_id = '183779'
OR person_id = '423327'
OR person_id = '664760'
OR person_id = '67318'
OR person_id = '28819'

# This showed that only Suspected killer 1 made a statement about the murder, which was as follows: "I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

# I ran the following query with the information from Suspected killer 1's statement to see if anyone in the drivers_license table met her description

SELECT * FROM drivers_license
WHERE height BETWEEN '65' AND '67'
AND gender = 'female'
AND hair_color = 'red'
AND car_make = 'Tesla'
AND car_model = 'Model S';

# The query returned 3 potential Suspected redheads. Their information (excluding the criteria used to filter our results) was as follows:

# Suspected redhead 1: id 202298, age 68, height 66, eye_color green, plate_number 500123
# Suspected redhead 2: id 291182, age 65, height 66, eye_color blue, plate_number 08CM64
# Suspected redhead 3: id 918773, age 48, height 65, eye_color black, plate_number 917UU3

# Next, I ran a query to determine which of these ids matched individuals that attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

SELECT person_id, event_id, event_name, COUNT(person_id) AS num_times_attended
FROM facebook_event_checkin
WHERE event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert'
AND date LIKE '201712%'
GROUP BY person_id
ORDER BY num_times_attended DESC;

# This query returned information for 2 suspects that had attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017. Their information (excluding the criteria used to filter our results) is as follows:

# Symphony suspect 1: person_id 24556, event_id 1143
# Symphony suspect 2: person_id 99716, event_id 1143

# I then used these ids to match them to individuals in the person table.

SELECT * FROM person
WHERE id = '24556' OR id = '99716';

# This query returned information for the following individuals:

# id 24556: name Bryan Pardo, license_id 101191, address_number 703, address_street_name Machine Ln, ssn 816663882
# id 99716: name Miranda Priestly, license_id 202298, address_number 1883, address_street_name Golden Ave, ssn 987756388

# To avoid any issues of gender bias, I then pulled Bryan and Miranda's information using their license_ids in the drivers_license table.

SELECT *
FROM drivers_license
WHERE id = '101191' OR id = '202298';

# This query only returned one row, which matched the earlier description of Suspected redhead 1, confirming that Miranda Priestly paid Jeremy Bowers to kill the victim.
